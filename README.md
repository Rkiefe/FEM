# FEM
Finite Element Method from scratch

This repository is dedicated to creating a simulation of different systems using the Finite Element Method.
It goes from the very start of the process, from the variational form of the differential equation, all the way to the actual programming required to output a result. The main language used is MATLAB but can easily be transposed to others such as Python or C.

The final goal of this project is to simulate the magnetic field of a solid metal with the most general boundary conditions possible in 2D. There are already free software available for this purpose such as FreeFEM or the FEMM, but my objective is to create a program from start to finish including mesh creation.

### Goal
> Magnetism of solids

## Current Status
> Able to solve the Poisson equation for the 1D case. This is equivelent to the bend of an elastic rod.
